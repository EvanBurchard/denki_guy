Denki Guy
=========

Denki Guy is a small framework based on akihabara with rails developers in mind.  The emphasis is less on a rich gaming experience and more on easily generating a 2d map for players to explore.  A LOT was cut from the original framework, and entrances to other pages (which actually require a new url) were added to enable a new take on the familiar paradigm of content + links.  

Perhaps this is most suitable as a konami code variant of another page.    

Setup

Usage
----

Features being considered
-----------
* A standard way of laying out sprites in an image file.  If this was realized, players could take their avatars with them from one denki guy site to another.
* A menuing extension of the dialogue system that will support decision trees, or even an interaction as complicated buying something from the ubiquitous "shops" that pepper old jrpgs
* Text input for less one sided conversations
* Internationalization in dialogues
* Akihabara reintegration to support more sophisticated npcs, weapons, hud, audio, and non-rpg style games
